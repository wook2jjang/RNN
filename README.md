# RNN
국민대학교 데이터사이언스학과 딥러닝 스터디 week04 입니다.

이번 스터디의 주제는 다음과 같습니다.

- RNN + torchtext tutorial
- HuggingFace

필요한 부분은 스탠포드 대학의 CS231n의 lecture note를 참조하였습니다. 

- lecture 5. Image Classification with CNNs

## This study is not for understanding all the mathematical details

– This study is for …
  
  • Understanding the core theory and the model (of deep learning)
  
  • Improve your programming skill (to make your own model with Pytorch)
  

– So, we are going to review many codes in detail (line by line)
  
  • Also, you have to implement by yourself!
  
  • Even if you continue to refer to the code published on Github, typing directly while reflecting on the meaning of each line is different from simply copying and pasting.
